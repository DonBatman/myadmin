# AIO - Double Tap Run

Bring a burst of speed to your game with this mod! Now, a quick double tap of the forward (up) key will make your character sprintâ€”**all while saving you the hassle of assigning a dedicated sprint key**.

## How It Works

- **Double Tap to Sprint:** Quickly press the forward (up) key twice to start running faster. This clever mechanism saves you from having to bind an extra key.
- **Easy Transition:** Just hold the key after the double tap to keep sprinting.
- **Smooth Return:** When you stop pressing the forward key, you go back to your normal pace.
- **Natural Braking:** Sprinting is automatically disabled if you touch water, keeping things realistic.

Enjoy a more intuitive and streamlined way to sprint through your adventures!
